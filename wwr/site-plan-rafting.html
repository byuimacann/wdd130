    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>My purpose is to provide my viewers with tried and tested destinations, reviews, safety and other pertinent information to help them select their next white water rafting adventure based on their preference and level of experience. I will have equipment rentals and rafting tours available to accommodate all rafting needs. A professional website will help me create an online presence and help build and expand my brand. Its ease of use, quality information, and appealing design will keep my customers—and their family and friends—coming back to use us again and again.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p> I feel white water rafting appeals more to a younger demographic. My target audience will be men and women ranging in age from 18-45 years old that enjoy outdoor activites and adventure.</p>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/97c7e2-20324c-f8be37-e65329-ffffff"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/97c7e2-20324c-f8be37-e65329-ffffff</a>

      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
