    <p>Hey everyone! I am working toward my Bachelor's Degree in Professional Studies. Last semester I finished the Graphic Design Fundamentals certificate and am now working on completing my Web Frontend certificate. I am planning on graduating by December 2023.</p>
    <p>My husband and I have been married for 22 years. We have lived in 3 different states and have 4 amazing kids who range in age from 14 to 21. Our oldest two children are away at college and so we only have two kids living at home with us.</p>
    <p>I stay busy with work, family, church callings, and school. I enjoy reading, watching a good movie, playing the piano, and spending time with my family and friends.</p>
